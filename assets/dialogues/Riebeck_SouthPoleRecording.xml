			<Page>I’m here! I did it! I put the ship down safely!</Page>
			<Page>Um, in that the ship went down, and I didn’t sustain bodily harm. A few minor repairs, and it’s like the ship never even hit those rocks!</Page>

			<Page>That’s the good news. The bad news... I, uh, haven’t found a way inside this structure yet. The door is broken, and I know I’m not great at exploring, but I think I would have found a different entrance by now if there were one. P... probably.</Page>
			<Page>I can’t get inside from <![CDATA[<i>]]>here<![CDATA[</i>]]>, but I know there are paths below the surface. I’m going to head north to the ruins on the equator to try to find a way down.</Page>

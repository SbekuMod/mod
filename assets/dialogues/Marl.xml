			<Page>So it’s launch day, huh? Hal’s going to miss you.</Page>
			<Page>Speaking of launch day... I was thinking about it, and the platform those ships launch from is getting old. Isn’t it about time you built a new, less flammable one?</Page>
			<Page>That big tree in the village would be the perfect choice. I wouldn’t mind helping out the space program. Just say the word!</Page>

			<Page>What? No, I just think it’s in the way and someone ought to chop it down, you know? Specifically, me.</Page>
			<Page>...Haha, you think this has to do with the time I fell out of it and broke my arm? That was when we were hatchlings! Who would hold a grudge for that long?</Page>

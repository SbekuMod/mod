<!--
This is for once players have gone through one of the four Gabbro intro paths

TO ADD: New Gabbro writing from summer/fall 2017 (has conditional option to tell Gabbro you’re turning the time loop device off, etc.)

TO ADD: Gabbro calling the player "time pal," "time buddy," "time loop bud," etc.

IDEA FOR LATER: Have Gabbro ask player about the ways they’ve died (or too macabre?).

IDEA FOR LATER: Have Gabbro ask player where they think the worst place to start a time loop would be!

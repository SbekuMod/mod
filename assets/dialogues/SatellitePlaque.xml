			<Page>The radio tower here on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and to this day still houses the first-ever photos taken of the entire solar system.</Page>
			<Page>These photos were made possible by the deep space satelliteâ€™s unusual vertical orbit that carries it high above (and below) the plane of the solar system.</Page>
			<Page>Thanks to a recent upgrade, the deep space satellite is now responsible for generating the real-time solar system map used by our newest astronauts.</Page>

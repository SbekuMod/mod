      <Page>I’ve detected a strange signal coming from somewhere within the grove in this crater.</Page>
      <Page>It’s very similar to the signal emitted by the Quantum Moon, so it stands to reason the two signals are probably related.</Page>
      <Page>We don’t know much about the Quantum Moon, seeing as no one’s ever been able to land on it, but hopefully studying the signal in the grove will reveal more about it.</Page>

      <Page>Trying to count moons for each planet is proving more difficult than expected.</Page>
      <Page>Does Timber Hearth has one or two moons? I have a hard time keeping tabs on this phantom moon we see sometime in orbit.</Page>
      <Page>I discovered a signal in the nearby crater, where Gabro hangs out all the time. A similar signal comes from the phantom moon! This might help me find the phantom moon in orbit.</Page>

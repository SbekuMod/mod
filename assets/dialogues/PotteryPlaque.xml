			<Page>Aside from the dwellings and structures they built, the Nomai also made art. This decorated pottery was discovered on Brittle Hollow.</Page>
			<Page>Some ancient Nomai art depicts strange animals, foreign celestial objects, and other subjects that canâ€™t be found in our solar system, which makes us wonder whether the Nomai originated elsewhere in the universe or simply had vibrant imaginations.</Page>
			<Page>Were the Nomai born in our solar system? Or were they born among other stars and planets - and if they were, how and why did they come here?</Page>
			<Page>These are just some of the questions we hope to answer through further xenoarchaeological expeditions.</Page>

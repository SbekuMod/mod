      <Page>Gabbro here, checking in on the deep space satellite per ground control's request to check out a possible equipment problem. See, Hornfels? I do too work!</Page>
      <Page>You know, I wouldn’t mind being a satellite. It's peaceful out here, among the distant stars and the soft, velvety darkness… Bet it's (yawn) awfully nice for naps, too...</Page>
      <Page>...</Page>
      <Page>Oh, right. The lens.</Page>
      <Page>Alright, little satellite, let's see what the trouble is.</Page>
      <Page>...Huh. Everything looks a-okay, ground control. No dust or scratches on the lens, and no evidence of sparking or violent explosions. Guess that rules out an equipment malfunction, after all.</Page>
      <Page>Hear that, pal? You’re in great shape. Keep up the good work out here!</Page>

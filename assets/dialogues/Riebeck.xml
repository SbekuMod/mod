			<Page>I’m here to see the Hanging City. It’s always been my dream to see it with my own four eyes, ever since I was a hatchling.</Page>
			<Page>An alien race lived in this solar system long before our species even existed! How could I <![CDATA[<i>]]>not<![CDATA[</i>]]> want to see what their civilization was like?</Page>
			<Page>Only...</Page>
			<Page>You’ve... probably heard the others say it, right? I’m afraid of space. Seriously, I’m more surprised than anybody that I’m out here.</Page>
			<Page>Do you want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Tripped over a gravity crystal. It’s dumb luck I landed somewhere my Little Scout says is halfway stable, instead of being sucked into... <![CDATA[<i>]]>what’s below<![CDATA[</i>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>I’ve been gauging the stability of the ground around me using my Little Scout, and this seems to be the place with the best surface integrity, so I’m just going to stay here until I’m ready to move on.</Page>
			<Page>...But that’s enough about me and my problems. You didn’t come all this way to listen to me blather, did you! Heh, that’d be... yeah.</Page>

			<Page>Oh wow, where <![CDATA[<i>]]>shouldn’t<![CDATA[</i>]]> you explore here?<![CDATA[<Pause>]]> Um, not the <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>black hole<![CDATA[</size>]]>, actually. That’s... very no.</Page>
			<Page>Which is unfortunate, because uh, the most exciting stuff is all below the crust. Including the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Hanging City</color>]]> — that’s just to the north. You can kinda see it from here.</Page>
			<Page>There’s also this big dome on the south pole called the <![CDATA[<color=orange>Southern Observatory</color>]]>. You can’t get inside from the surface — trust me, I tried — but if it’s like the rest of the Nomai structures here, there’s probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere.</Page>
			<Page>Good luck with exploring. Um, if you learn anything about the Nomai, I’d love to hear it, <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>if it’s not too much trouble?<![CDATA[</size>]]></Page>

			<Page>Wow! So then, the Nomai probably came here from somewhere outside the solar system. And they must have been in trouble when they launched their escape pod... but what kind of trouble?</Page>
			<Page>And where did the escape pod launch from? I’m so curious!</Page>
			<Page>This is an amazing discovery. I hope we can find out more about how and why the Nomai arrived here!</Page>

			<Page>You did?! That, that’s incredible, congratulations!</Page>
			<Page>That means they really <![CDATA[<i>]]>were<![CDATA[</i>]]> from far outside our solar system. Haha, <![CDATA[<i>]]>yes<![CDATA[</i>]]>! I knew it!</Page>
			<Page>But that creates so many new questions! If they didn’t come from our solar system, where did they come from? Are they from our galaxy, or somewhere even farther? What were their lives like before they came here? And <![CDATA[<i>]]>why<![CDATA[</i>]]> did they come here?</Page>
			<Page>Hey, I... I might not be much of an astronaut, but I’m really glad I came out here to see the Nomai’s artifacts for myself. And, um, thanks for telling me. <![CDATA[<Pause/>]]>About the Vessel, I mean.</Page>

			<Page>You visited the Hanging City? Oh gosh, how was it? Was it amazing? Was it beautiful? ...Was it scary?</Page>
			<Page>The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!</Page>
			<Page>Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a <![CDATA[<i>]]>you-know-what<![CDATA[</i>]]> is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the <![CDATA[<size=20>]]>black hole<![CDATA[</size>]]> for something?</Page>

			<Page>You mean there’s another Nomai city <![CDATA[<i>]]>inside<![CDATA[</i>]]> of Ember Twin? That’s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!</Page>
			<Page>How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!</Page>
			<Page>That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.</Page>

			<Page>A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!</Page>
			<Page>It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.</Page>
			<Page>Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?</Page>

			<Page>That’s... really sad, isn’t it? I know it was a long time ago, but still...</Page>
			<Page>Stars above, it’s lucky we hadn’t evolved to live on land yet.</Page>
			<Page>To think, if the comet hadn’t killed them, our species might have coexisted in this solar system. That would have been amazing.</Page>
			<Page>But...</Page>
			<Page>I guess if I hadn’t wanted to learn why the Nomai disappeared, I’d never have left Timber Hearth and come out here, or had any of these adventures.</Page>

			<Page>Great! So I just have to go back into space, fly to the Quantum Moon with zero visibility, find a spooky ruin, and travel through a few different types of dangerous terrain to get there.</Page>
